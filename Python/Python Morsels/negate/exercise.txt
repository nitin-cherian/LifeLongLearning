I'd like you to write a function that accepts a list of lists of numbers and returns a new list of lists with each of the numbers negated.

It should work something like this:
>>> matrix = [[1, -2], [-3, 4]]
>>> negate(matrix)
[[-1, 2], [3, -4]]
>>> matrix = [[1, -2, 3], [-4, 5, -6], [7, -8, 9]]
>>> negate(matrix)
[[-1, 2, -3], [4, -5, 6], [-7, 8, -9]]
There's no bonuses this week, but I'd like you to put some effort into figuring out the clearest and most idiomatic way to solve this problem.

I've written some tests to make it easier to ensure your code functions as expected. You can download the test file here. You'll need to write your function in a module named negate.py next to where you've saved that test file. To run the tests you'll run "python test_negate.py" and check the output for "OK".

You'll receive some answers and links to resources explaining ways to solve this exercise within a few days. Don't peek at the answers before attempting to solve this on your own.
