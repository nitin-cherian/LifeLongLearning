I want you to write a function that accepts a string and returns a mapping (a dictionary or dictionary-like structure) that has words as the keys and the number of times each word was seen as the values.

Your function should work like this:
>>> count_words("oh what a day what a lovely day")
{'oh': 1, 'what': 2, 'a': 2, 'day': 2, 'lovely': 1}
>>> count_words("don't stop believing")
{"don't": 1, 'stop': 1, 'believing': 1}

As a bonus, make sure your function works well with mixed case words:
>>> count_words("Oh what a day what a lovely day")
{'oh': 1, 'what': 2, 'a': 2, 'day': 2, 'lovely': 1}

For even more of a bonus try to get your function to ignore punctuation outside of words:
>>> count_words("Oh what a day, what a lovely day!")
{'oh': 1, 'what': 2, 'a': 2, 'day': 2, 'lovely': 1}


Automated tests for this week's exercise can be found here. You'll need to write your function in a module named anagram.py next to the test file. To run the tests you'll run "python test_anagram.py" and check the output for "OK". You'll see that there are some "expected failures" (or "unexpected successes" maybe). If you'd like to do the bonus, you'll want to comment out a line or two of code to test them properly. You'll see those noted in the test file.
