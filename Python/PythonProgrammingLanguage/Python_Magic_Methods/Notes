Python Magic Methods
===================

-- When defining objects, it is usally beneficial to make your object play nicely with other parts of Python.

-- This is done through special/magic methods.


9.1 Use of magic methods to implement operators
===============================================

-- Every operation on Python objects involves a special method call underneath the covers

-- For eg:

>>> a = 10
>>> a + 10
20
>>> a.__add__(10)
20
>>> a * 10
100
>>> a.__mul__(10)
100


The + operator is actually calling the special method __add__ of the integer object

This applies to any other objects in Python also:

>>> company = ['IBM', 'FB', ' GOOGLE']
>>> company[1]
'FB'
>>> company.__getitem__(1)
'FB'
>>> company[2] = 'AA'
>>> company
['IBM', 'FB', 'AA']
>>> company.__setitem__(2, 'BB')
>>> company
['IBM', 'FB', 'BB']


-- We can use these special methods in our custom objects also

   >>> class Point:
   ...     def __init__(self, x, y):
   ...         self.x = x
   ...         self.y = y
   ...     def __add__(self, other):
   ...         print('Add other')
   ...         
   >>> p = Point(3, 4)
   >>> p + 10
   Add other


   -- The implementor of the class is free to do what he wants to do when the object is used during an add operation.

   -- Notice how it works smoothly just like any other objects in Python.

9.2. Making objects printable and debuggable
=========================================

-- Refer holding.py

-- When you give the holding object to the REPL or try to print it, it does not show any useful o/p

>>> from holding import read_portfolio, Holding
>>> h = Holding('AA', '2016-08-09', 100, 45.6)
>>> h
<holding.Holding object at 0x7fa64ac6e400>
>>> print(h)
<holding.Holding object at 0x7fa64ac6e400>

-- __repr__ and __str__ magic methods

-- __repr__

   -- Used for developer debugging

   -- Invoked when you try to give the object to the REPL or use the repr method on the object

   >>> from holding import Holding
   >>> h = Holding('IBM', '2016-09-08', 100, 56.7)
   >>> h
   Holding('IBM', '2016-09-08', 100, 56.7)
   >>> repr(h)
   "Holding('IBM', '2016-09-08', 100, 56.7)"

-- __str__

   -- Used for giving useful o/p to the user

   -- Invoked when you try to print the object using print method or use the string conversion function str on the object

   >>> print(h)
   100 shares of IBM at $56.70
   >>> str(h)
   '100 shares of IBM at $56.70'


-- Both functions must return a string representation of the object.

-- It is highly recommended to use these special methods in almost all classes for debugging purposes.

9.3 Making a custom container object
===================================

-- Refer holding.py

-- In the previous version of the program, the read_portfolio() function returned a list of holding objects

-- Someone may need a custom portfolio class, may be to implement custom methods like total_cost, current_value etc

-- In this case, we can make a custom class 'Portfolio' that serves as a container for the list of holding object

-- In __init__ method, we initialize an empty list of holding objects

-- Create a classmethod which serves as an alterante customer which populates the list of holding objects from csv file using th read_portfolio method.

-- For that read_portfolio is moved into the custom class

-- Now if we make an object like so:

>>> from holding import Portfolio
>>> portfolio = Portfolio.from_csv('Data/portfolio.csv')
>>> portfolio.holdings
[Holding('"AA"', '"2007-05-11"', 100, 32.2), Holding('"IBM"', '"2007-08-11"', 50, 91.1),


-- The portfolio object contains the list of holding objects

-- Here is the problem:

  -- By making a custom container, almost everything you could do with a list is brocken

     -- I cannot get the length of the portfolio

     >>> len(portfolio)
     Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "/usr/lib/python3.5/code.py", line 91, in runcode
     exec(code, self.locals)
     File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
     TypeError: object of type 'Portfolio' has no len(

     -- I cannot index the portfolio
     portfolio[1]
     Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "/usr/lib/python3.5/code.py", line 91, in runcode
     exec(code, self.locals)
     File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
     TypeError: 'Portfolio' object does not support indexing

     -- I cannot loop through the portfolio
     >>> for holding in portfolio:
     ...     print(holding)
     ...     
     Traceback (most recent call last):
       File "/usr/lib/python3.5/code.py", line 91, in runcode
           exec(code, self.locals)
             File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
             TypeError: 'Portfolio' object is not iterable
             
  -- Reason for breakage: The Custom Class does not implement any of the special methods to use any of the operations above


  -- Inorder to avoid this problem, I could have implemented a size method for getting the length,

     def size(self):
       return len(self.holdings)

     I could have implmented getHolding method which returns a holding

     def getHolding(self, n):
        return self.holdings[n]


     -- However, this is normally not the way Python programmers do programming

     -- They use the len method for finding the length of something, they use the indexing to get an element

  -- Instead, implement the special methods which plays nicely with Python

     -- when you invoke len(), __len__ gets called
     -- When you invoke indexing, __getitem__ gets called
     -- When you invoke looping, __iter__ gets called

     >>> p = Portfolio.from_csv('Data/portfolio.csv')
     >>> len(p)
     7
     >>> p[2]
     Holding('"CAT"', '"2007-06-11"', 150, 83.44)
     >>> p[3]
     Holding('"MSFT"', '"2007-09-11"', 200, 51.23)
     >>> for holding in p:
     ...     print(holding)
     ...     
     100 shares of "AA" at $32.20
     50 shares of "IBM" at $91.10
     150 shares of "CAT" at $83.44
     200 shares of "MSFT" at $51.23
     95 shares of "GE" at $40.70
     50 shares of "MSFT" at $65.10
     100 shares of "IBM" at $70.44


  -- Now I can get a little more creative,

     for instance, I can overload the __getitem__ method used for indexing

     -- Refer holding.py

        -- If the user supplies a name, the holding matching the name is returned, else the holdings list is indexed by the supplied index

        >>> portfolio[2]
        Holding('"CAT"', '"2007-06-11"', 150, 83.44)
        >>> portfolio['"IBM"']
        [Holding('"IBM"', '"2007-08-11"', 50, 91.1), Holding('"IBM"', '"2007-03-11"', 100, 70.44)]

   -- There are many things you could do using special methods. Use a reference manual.


9.4 Making a custom context manager
==================================

-- related to resource management in python

-- for instance the common pattern is like so:

   f = open('filename.csv')
   data = f.read
   f.close

   -- you open a file
   -- use the file
   -- and then close the file

   import threading
   lock = threading.Lock()
   lock.acquire()
   print("Do something")
   lock.release()

   -- you acquire a lock
   -- do something 
   -- release the lock

-- this is the problem: what happens:

   1. If we don't close the file or release the lock -- the resource gets wasted
   2. Some error occurs before closing the file or releasing the lock and the program exits -- the resource gets wasted.

-- The common pattern to avoid the above problew: use with clause

   with open('filename') as f:
     data = f.read()


   >>> lock = threading.Lock()
   >>> with lock:
   ...    print("Do something")
   ... 

-- with clause takes care of cleaning up the resource 

   -- we don't have to close the file or release the lock.

-- It is worth knowing how with clause works under the covers

   -- that can used to make with work with our custom objects.

   -- so we are looking it is 'Context Manager'

   -- what drives that with statement

      -- is a pair of __enter__ and __exit__ special methods

   -- refer manager.py

   -- Since the __enter__ and __exit__ methods are implementer for the Manager class

      -- the with statement can be used with the instances of the Manager class

      >>> from manager import Manager
      >>> m = Manager()
      >>> with m:
      ...     print("Hello World")
      ...     
      Entering
      Hello World
      Exiting
      None None None


      Code that is used within the with clause is bracketed between the entering and exiting methods.

   -- the idea is both __enter__ and __exit__ methods could do some bookeeping work.

      -- like __exit__ could release a lock or close a file.

   -- Notice that the enter methods returns a value

      -- this is what drives the as clause like so:

      >>> with m as val:
      ...     print("Hello World, val = ", val)
      ...     
      Entering
      Hello World, val =  some value
      Exiting
      None None None


      -- similar to how we normally use open on files 

      >>> from manager import Manager
      >>> with Manager() as val:
      ...     print("Hello World, val = ", val)
      ...     
      Entering
      Hello World, val =  some value
      Exiting


      -- what is stored in val above is the return value of the __enter__ method

   -- the exit method takes three parameters

      if an exception occurs: the exception type, value and traceback is stored in these parameters.
