Statically Typed Language
-------------------------

-- the variable name is bound to:
   1. a type (at compile time)
   2. an object (optional)

-- cannot be bound to an object of different type at a later stage.


Dynamically Type Language
-------------------------

-- the variable name is bound only to the object and not to a type.

-- binding happens at run-time

-- can be bound to an object of different type at run-time.


eg: In Python, the following code is valid

a = "hello"
a = 10


Weakly Typed Language
---------------------

-- Unrelated types (eg: int, str) can be coerced implicitly.

eg: In javascript the below code is valid:

var a = 10
var b = "hello"
var c = a + b

The integer 10 is implictly converted to a string before concatenation.

Strongly Typed Language
-----------------------

-- Unrelated types cannot be coerced implicitly. Needs explicit type convertion.

eg: In Python the below code is not valid

a = 10
b = "hello"
c = a + b

However, if a is explicitly converted to a string like given below, it is valid

a = 10
b = "hello"
c = str(10) + b


Bottom Line
===========

Python is a dynamically and strongly typed language.
