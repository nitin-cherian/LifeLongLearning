1. Installing Docker
===================

Installing on Linux
------------------

-- Do not use default apt/yum to install Docker

   -- The packages will be old and not official Docker-Built packages.

-- Use Docker's automated script to add their repo and install dependencies

   -- curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh


2. Course Chat Room
===================

General Steps:

1. Go to chat.dockermastery.com and give it your email address.
2. You will be sent an email from Slack, with a invite link inside it.
3. Click that link.
4. Fill out the form to create your Slack account.
5. Use that Slack account to access dockermastery.slack.com

3. Check Docker Install and Config
=================================

-- # docker version

   -- shows 2 sections: Client and Server
   -- Client --> The CLI which communicates with Server through APIs
   -- Server --> Docker Engine
             -- Docker Engine runs as a daemon
             -- It can be local meaning Client and Server can be on the same machine
             -- Or it can be remote to the Client.

-- # docker info

   -- Detailed info of the docker system which is running
   -- It contains info such as how many docker images, docker containers etc.

-- These 2 commands confirm that Docker is up and running.


-- # docker

   -- This command will list all the available docker commands the CLI supports.

-- docker command format

   docker <command> <subcommand> (options)

   This is the new format

   while the old format was:

   docker <command> (options)
