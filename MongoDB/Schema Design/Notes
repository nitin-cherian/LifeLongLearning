MongoDB Schema Design Facts
---------------------------

- Application Driven Schema
- Rich Documents
  - Store any array, value or entire document
- Pre Join / Embded data
  - Store and array, value or entire document
- No Mongo joins
- No constraints like foreign key constraints due to embedding
- Atomic operations, but no transactions as in Relational DB
- No declared Schema

3rd Normal Form(3NF)
--------------------

- A non-key attribute must desscribe a fact about the key, the whole key and nothing but
the key
- Suppose we have a posts table where post_id is the key and it has anttribute author and
author_email. This table is brocken and not in 3NF, because, the author_email is not 
describing the key post_id, but another attribute 'author'.
