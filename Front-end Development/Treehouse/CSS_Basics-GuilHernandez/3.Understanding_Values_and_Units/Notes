2. Pixel units

  -- if used, the size will remain the same irrespective of the browser window and size of the screen.

  -- however, pixels(px) are relative to the viewing device. 
     -- 1px is 1 device pixel for low resolution devices and multiple device pixels for high resolution devices.

  -- .main-header {
      width: 960px;
    }

    main-header will always take up 960px of the screen.

3. Percentage units

  -- Number values can be expressed more fluidly using percentages.

  -- Percentage value is measured relative to the parent element's length.


  .main-header {
    width: 75%;
    }
