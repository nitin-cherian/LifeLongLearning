1. CSS Resources

   -- Helpful resources for learning and staying up-to-date with CSS.

      -- MDN (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
      -- Webplatform.corg (https://www.webplatform.org/docs/css/)
      -- W3C (https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html)
      -- Can I Use (http://caniuse.com/)

2. Linking to an external style sheet

   -- <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
     
      -- The 'rel' attribute specifies the relationship between the HTML document and the linked document.
      -- The 'href' attribute points to the location of the CSS file.

3. Importing Style Sheets with @import

   -- @import 'reset-styles.css';

      -- The @import statement must precede all other CSS rules in a stylesheet in order for it to work properly.3. Importing Style Sheets with @import
 
4. Universal selector
   
   -- The universal selector targets every element at once and applies the styles we set.
   
   -- * {
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
      }

5. Type selector

   -- Targets a particulat html element or type.

6. ID selector

   -- declared using pound(#) symbol, followed by ID name.

   #primary-content {
     background: grey;
   }

   This selector will matach the HTML element with an ID attribute with the valud primary-content.

   -- IDs are unique to the page, so an element can only have one ID and a page can only have one element with same ID name. 

   -- What are fragment identifiers? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_identifier

7. Class selector

   -- define with . character followed by the class name.

8. Reusing classes

   -- Sometimes we may have lot of CSS repeated in our stylesheets. In those cases create a class and put the commoon CSS in it.
   -- Space-separate each class name in the class attribute

      -- <div class="primary-content t-border rounded">

9. Using ID selector and class selector on the same element

   -- ID selector carries more weight and it overrides the same property in the class selector.

10. Descendant selector
    
    -- Can combine selectors to create descendant selectors which targets elements that are descendants of an element. This makes the selector more specific

    -- To create a descendant selector we need to use two or more selectors separated by white spaces.

    .main-header span {
     font-size: 26px;
    }

    ul li {
    margin-bottom: 12px;
    }

11. Pseudo selector

    -- keywords that are added to selectors to style a special state of an element.

    -- The :link pseudo-class targets links that have not been visited by the user:

    a:link {
      color: orange;
    }

    -- The :visited pseudo-class targets links that have been visited –– or clicked –– by the user

    -- The :hover pseudo-class targets an element when a user hovers over it

    -- The :active pseudo-class gets applied when an element is in an active state

    -- The :focus pseudo-class is only applied to interactive elements like links, buttons and form elements. The styles are applied as soon as the element receives focus

12. Using CSS Comments

    -- Comments in CSS starts with forward-slash followed by asterix and ends with asterix followed by forward-slash

    -- /*  CSS Comment. This applies to single line as well as multiline */
