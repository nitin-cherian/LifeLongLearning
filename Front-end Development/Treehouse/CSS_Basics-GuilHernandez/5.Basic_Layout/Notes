1. Width and Height Properties
------------------------------

- an elements width and height are as wide or tall as the content it holds.
- total height or width is affected by the padding, border.

2.box-sizing property
---------------------

-- sometimes the above behaviour is not waht we want.
-- we may not want the padding and border to affect the total height or width of the element.
-- use box-sizing in this case.

3. max-width property
---------------------

-- Usually this property is used when the percentage value is used for width.
-- prevents the fluidity of the element not to stretch beyond a max width.
-- for images to be responsive, usually the following is done

   img {
    max-width: 100%;
   }

   This makes sure that the img always has a max width of the parent elements width. So if the parent is responsive, img will also be responsive.
