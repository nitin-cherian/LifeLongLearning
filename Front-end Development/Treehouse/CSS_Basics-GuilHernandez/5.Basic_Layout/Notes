1. Width and Height Properties
------------------------------

- an elements width and height are as wide or tall as the content it holds.
- total height or width is affected by the padding, border.

2.box-sizing property
---------------------

-- sometimes the above behaviour is not what we want.
-- we may not want the padding and border to affect the total height or width of the element.
-- use box-sizing in this case.

3. max-width property
---------------------

-- Usually this property is used when the percentage value is used for width.
-- prevents the fluidity of the element not to stretch beyond a max width.
-- for images to be responsive, usually the following is done

   img {
    max-width: 100%;
   }

   This makes sure that the img always has a max width of the parent elements width. So if the parent is responsive, img will also be responsive.

4. Backgrounds: colors and images
---------------------------------

-- background layer of an element: everything except the margin of the element.
    -- transparent by default.
    -- can be filled with color or image.

-- background-image property
    -- the image is by default repeated or tiled both horizontally and vertically.
    -- if the image is large, it may not repeat.

-- background-size property
    -- set the size of the background image
    -- .main-header {
         background-size: 40%;
       }

       -- when percentage is used, the size is relative to the width and height of the background area.
       -- Not relative to the image's width and height.

-- background-repeat propety
    -- by default, the background image repeats both horizontally and vertically.
    -- this can be controlled using background-repeat property.
    -- can be controlled to repeat, no-repeat, repeat-x, repeat-y and so on - default is repeat.
    -- it is a good idea to put background-color property, in case the image is not available or user disable images in browser.

-- background-position property
    -- by default, the image is placed at the top left corner.
    -- sets the position of the background image in the background area.
    .main-header {
    background-position: center top;
                         /* horizontal vertical */
    }

-- background-size: cover

   .main-header {
     background-image: url('../img/mountains.jpg');     
     background-size: cover;
   }

   The cover value adjusts the background area so that it's completely covered by the background image, while maintaining its width and height proportions


-- the short hand for all the above background properties is 'background'
